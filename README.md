# Games-R-ust
A rust game engine library with a cheesy name and no other likable attributes based off of FLTK and directly using OpenGL for graphics



The library is written in c++ but the end product is a 2d game engine for rust, please contribute however you like, if you are contributing you probably know more about this than me

disclaimer:
I am a high shcool student who is not currently in any cs classes and have never been in a class teaching any of the software I am using so please don't blame me for it being total crap, thank you
