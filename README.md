# Games-R-ust


- A rust game engine library with a cheesy name and no other likable attributes based off of FLTK and directly using OpenGL for graphics
- The goal of Games-R-ust (abbreviated as "grs") is to provide a game engine without abstraction, where concepts are easy to understand but give a deeper understnding of the language
- The library is written in c++ but the end product is a 2d game engine for rust 




Please contribute however you like, if you are contributing you probably know more about this than me
I am not using any sort of conventions and wish it to stay that way, (I guess all caps can be used for constants but it is not neccesary)
A more important convention is that all names are short, NOTHING should be over 20 characters in length.



disclaimer:
I am a high shcool student who is not currently in any cs classes and have never been in a class teaching any of the software I am using so please don't blame me for it being total crap, thank you
